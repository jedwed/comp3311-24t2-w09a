a. What functional dependencies are implied if we know that a set of attributes X is a candidate key for a relation R?
X functionally determines all attributes in relation R

b. What functional dependencies can we infer do not hold by inspection of the following relation?

| A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a   | 1   | x   |
| b   | 2   | y   |
| c   | 1   | z   |
| d   | 2   | x   |
| a   | 1   | y   |
| b   | 2   | z   |

- A -/> C
- A -> B
- B -/> C
- A -/> BC
- etc.

c. Suppose that we have a relation schema R(A,B,C) representing a relationship between two entity sets E and F with keys A and B respectively, and suppose that R has (at least) the functional dependencies A → B and B → A. Explain what this tells us about the relationship between E and F.

Relationship between entity sets E and F: one-to-one cardinality
