## Question 4

Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D).
For each of the following sets of functional dependencies,
assuming that those are the only dependencies that hold for R, do the following:

(! Tip for finding candidate keys: if an attribute doesn't appear in the RHS: it HAS to be in the candidate key)

a. List all of the candidate keys for R.
b. Show whether R is in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)?
c. Show whether R is in third normal form (3NF)?

i. {C → D, C → A, B → C}
a. Find the candidate keys
- B+ = {B, C, D, A}
b. is it in BCNF

Consider each functional dependency
C -> D
1. Not trivial
2. Not a superkey
3. D is not a subset of any candidate key (B) 

It's not in BCNF nor 3NF

ii. B → C, D → A

- BD+ = {B, D, C, A} -> candidate key

b. Is it in 3NF, BCNF

B -> C
1. Not trivial
2. Not a superkey
3. C is not a subset of any candidate key (BD)
It's not in BCNF nor 3NF

iii. ABC → D, D → A

- ABC+ = {A, B, C, D} -> candidate key
- BCD+ = {B, C, D, A} -> candidate key

- A+ = {A}

Loop through all fds
- ABC -> D
1. Not trivial
2. ABC is a superkey

Satisfies condition for BCNF, 3NF

- D -> A
1. Not trivial
2. D is not a superkey
3. A is a subset of a candidate key (ABC)

Satisfies condition for 3NF but NOT BCNF

The relation is in 3NF but not BCNF
